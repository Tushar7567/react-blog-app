                {"id":13,"article-content":"Philosophy of technology is a branch of philosophy that studies the practice of designing and creating artifacts, and the nature of the things so created. It emerged as a discipline over the past two centuries, and has grown considerably since the 1970s. The humanities philosophy of technology is concerned with the meaning of technology for, and its impact on, society and culture. Initially, technology was seen as an extension of the human organism that replicated or amplified bodily and mental faculties. Marx framed it as a tool used by capitalists to oppress the proletariat, but believe technology would be a fundamentally liberating force once it was freed from societal deformations.Second-wave philosophers like Ortega later shifted their focus from economics and politics to  life and living in a techno-material culture, arguing that technology could oppress even the bourgeoisie who were its ostensible masters and protectors. Third-stage philosophers like Don Ihde and Albert Borgmann represent a turn toward de-generalization and empiricism, and considered how humans can learn to live with technology."}
